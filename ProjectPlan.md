# Project Plan  


**Author**: \<Alexandra Jie Yang Springteam69>


## 1 Introduction:

Project is to develop an Android app that implements the payment and rewards management system for mobile stalls that Brad and Janet envisioned 

## 2 Process Description  
### 2.1 Business modeling 
- Model the android application based on payment and rewards program detailed process flows 
- Entrance criteria: business objectives, project time line, project expenditure
- Exit criteria: Meet business requirements, under the project budget, produce the code and deliver the solution within the timeline 

### 2.2 Requirements: 
- Gathering the technical and software requirements and interview each stakeholder for input details. 
- Entrance criteria: system requirement, business process flows, demanded businesses entities, required skill set and human resources 
- Exit criteria: meet the minimum operational required systems, gathered business process flows, gathered business entities and defined the developer and tester skill sets and knowledge required. 

### 2.3 Analysis & Design 
- Analyze system requirement based on the business application requirement, define each class, each operation between classes and the associations. Define the participating business entities, define number of developers needed, define tester needed, define the project manager, define the user manual writers. Define the project time line and budget. 
- Entrance criteria: necessary tools available including IDE, testing automation tools, project management tools, budgeting management tools. 
- Exit criteria: Finish project plan, finish the design document, finish the vision document, start the user manual, start project management plan. 

### 2.4 Implementation: 
- Start implementing the Android application design based on the design architecture document, and test plan, using agile development methodology to develop the application with daily build and daily deployment throughout the deployment lifecycle. 
- Entrance criteria: architecture document ready, design diagram ready, IDE and testing tools are ready to use 
- Exit criteria: All android application started at elaboration phase and through the construction phase to transition phase. Each class, operations among the classes, and associations are clearly coded and completed, the testing phase has begun as soon as the coding effort has started 

### 2.5 Test
- Testing the code completed with the phased approach and retest the code after each iteration, 
- Entrance criteria: tests plan are completed and with the code implemented and reiteration, the test plan will change accordingly to reflect the application design 
- Exit criteria: test plans are well executed and each test case is tested against the use case and unit testing, integration testing and system testing are all perform before released to the internal stakeholders and beta customers testing to collect feedback, check the expenditure and make sure it is still within the budget. 

### 2.6 Implementation
- Implement the Android application in the real market and provide the users training and support hotline. 
- Entrance criteria: Prepare the application release note, and schedule the users training sessions and provide the user manual and provide support contact information 
- Exit criteria: User or stakeholders accepted the application, no bugs are found or the bugs have been filed with the support team. Completed users training, and users feel comfortable starting using the application, the project completely under the budget and timeline.
