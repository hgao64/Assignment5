## 1 Introduction

Payment and Rewards Management System (PReMS) is an application running on the Android OS that will let user manage payment and rewards information for mobile stalls. It is intended to be used by stall manager who need to know whether a stall customer get discount from a purchase, how much discount a customer has, etc. 

## 2 Business Needs/Requirements

Brad and Janet, farmers who sell their produce regularly at local farmers markets, have no better way to manage the condition of their customer's discount. They want to (1) allow their customers to pay using a credit card and (2) reward their most loyal customers. 

To reach the goals, they want to develop a management system. After they saw our team design, they need help to develop an Android app that implements the payment and rewards management system for mobile stalls. 

Since they were fascinated by Unified Modeling Language (UML), they want our team to follow a UML-based process during the development of this system. 

## 3 Product / Solution Overview

PReMS will be an Android application that provides a user interface for management of stall customer's purchase and related discount.
