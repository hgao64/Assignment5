# Vision Document

*Vision represents the end user's or customer's ideas and views of the software product to be developed. The Vision Document generally contains the key business needs and features of the system from the stakeholder perspective. The Vision Document is simply a mechanism to put down on paper "the idea".*

## 1 Introduction

*Here you introduce the product. Keep this  clean 	and simple, one or two sentences at most.*
Payment and Rewards Management System (PReMS) is an application running on the Android OS that will let user manage payment and reward information for mobile stalls. It is intended to be used by stall manager who need to know whether a stall customer get discount from a purchase, how many discount a customer has, etc. 

## 2 Business Needs/Requirements

*Here you discuss the reason you are planning to build your product. Youâ€™ll want to talk about the problem people are facing, the requirements you need to meet to solve that problem (10000-foot view), and the market itself. Essentially, youâ€™re making a case that the product needs to be built.*
Brad and Janet, farmers who sell their produce regularly at local farmers markets, have no better way to manage the condition of their customer's discount. They want to (1) allow their customers to pay using a credit card and (2) reward their most loyal customers. 

To reach the goals, they want to develop a management system. After they saw our team design, they need help to develop an Android app that implements the payment and rewards management system for mobile stalls. 

Since they were fascinated by unified modeling language (UML), they want our team to follow a UML-based process during the development of this system. 

## 3 Product / Solution Overview

*Here you talk about the product itself. Give a high level overview of the solution and how it meets the needs outlined above. Optionally, you can talk about plans for both this version and future versions.*
PReMS will be an Android application that provides a user interface for management of customer, purchase and related discount information. By using this system, stall manager can save user information, display user's purchase record, and user's discount condition. The system will automatically determine user's discount according to purchase history and sent email to reminder customer about their discount. User can display summary of user's payment and rewards. 

In the future version we may 
-allow customer to decide when and how much they would like to use their discount
-allow user to add and edit more different discount level

## 4 Major Features (Optional)

*Here you outline the features at a high level (a detailed feature outline belongs in the requirements document.) Some people prefer to outline features in the above Product/Solution Overview section, which is also a fine approach. Whatever you do, keep it to bullet points, not paragraphs. If you can use pictures, such as mockups, even better.*

## 5 Scope and Limitations

*The Scope and Limitations section is where you talk about what is, and in particular, what is not included. This is where you tactfully tell your boss that his pet feature is not going to be included.*
